#MiniCSP - Microsoft 365 Accounts Keeper
##Overview
MiniCSP is a solution developed to address the challenge of synchronized global admin accounts across multiple machines and support agents, particularly for customers who are transitioning to Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for enhanced security. 
It provides a secure method for managing credentials across multiple users while keeping the information within the company's boundaries, ensuring data safety.


###Key Features
MiniCSP was designed with local Network storage drives (NAS) in mind, utilizing SQLite to store data. This enables users to set up and begin using the application within seconds.

###Why Choose MiniCSP?
In the field of account management tools, MiniCSP stands out as an alternative option, offering multi-sync compatibility on a local NAS storage. While tools like KeePass are great choice, they may lack the flexibility needed for managing users for this specific use-case.

While primarily a portfolio project, MiniCSP is fully capable of production use after intense testing across multiple machines. 
It's important to note that the app not used in production true to this date.

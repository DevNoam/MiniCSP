# MiniCSP - Microsoft 365 Accounts Keeper
### Overview
MiniCSP is a solution developed to address the challenge of synchronized global admin accounts across multiple machines and agents, and in a time where organizations transitioning to Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.
This tool was born out of the necessity observed within my own company, where the need for streamlined account management became apparent.


### Key Features
MiniCSP developed for local Network storage drives (NAS) in mind, thats why it uses SQLite to store the data, meaning that users can get up and running within seconds.



### Version Information
This release of MiniCSP is branded, featuring my company's logo and name. However, it is freely available for both personal and commercial use. 
I have no plans on removing the brand out of it. contributions are always welcome, if its uploading an Issue or improving the app.
